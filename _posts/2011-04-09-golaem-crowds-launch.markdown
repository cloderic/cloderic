For the past few months we've been working at Golaem on our new product: Golaem Crowd, a Maya plugin dedicated to crowd simulation for the VFX and animation market. While I didn't work on the Maya integration, my work on Golaem Path (navigation mesh generation and navigation behaviors) is a major part of the software and provides much added value.

For the past hours lots of [vfx](http://www.vizworld.com/2011/04/golaem-launches-golaem-crowd-fmx/) [news](http://www.cgrecord.net/2011/04/golaem-crowd-for-autodesk-maya-released.html) [sites](http://www.cgchannel.com/2011/04/golaem-launches-new-high-end-crowd-simulator/) covered the launch and the generated buzz is [pretty amazing](http://twitter.com/#!/search/golaem%20crowd).
