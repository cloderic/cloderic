I'm so trendy, I now have a brand new [github account](https://github.com/cloderic)!

I'm using it both as a git repo for my WebGL experiments and, thanks to their well thought [pages](http://pages.github.com/) feature as a hosting facility for the project itself. You can check this awesome work at [paperplane.crowdscontrol.net](http://paperplane.crowdscontrol.net/). Stable versions of the project will be published there.

Don't get too excited though, there's nothing impressive to show yet, just a crate to manipulate with the mouse. This is the basis for <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">my world conquest!</span> my hopefully, someday, working WebGL toy. Anyway there's a ton of things I've done for the first time with this little website and spinning crate: working JavaScript, git repository, light css, markdown files, and of course WebGL.

This is so lame for the moment I'm wondering why I'm even writing this, but, heh, I'm a little proud!
