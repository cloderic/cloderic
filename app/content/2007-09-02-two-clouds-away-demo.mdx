In 2005, I founded Two Clouds Away with [Florian Nouviale](https://soundcloud.com/flonou) in Rennes, France while we were at University (INSA de Rennes), the band existed under various incarnations until about 2012.

This is our first demo, we recorded it in our rehearsal space in 2007. At the time, the band was composed of (left to right on the photo above):

- **Alexandre Lacroix** - Bass
- **Florian Nouviale** - Guitars, Synth, Backing Vocals
- **Gwendal Bars** - Drums
- **Clod√©ric Mars** - Lead Vocal, Guitars
