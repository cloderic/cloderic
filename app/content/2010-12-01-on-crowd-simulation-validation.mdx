Autonomous agents navigation is a very wide topic applied to a wide range of
specific domains: Military simulation, public spaces design, games, CG FX and
animation, training... Each of these fields has its definitions of a _valid_
human-like characters and while the artistic aspect is very important in games
or animation it is not for military simulations for exemple. Validations methods
are numerous and each is suited for a few parameters only:

- Motion captured data in labs can be used to check agents trajectories and
  velocities in various scenarios (cf.
  [Julien Pettr√© work](http://www.irisa.fr/bunraku/GENS/jpettre/));

- Survey can evaluate various visual aspects of virtual humans (cf.
  [Rachel McDonnell work](http://gv2.cs.tcd.ie/mcdonner/));
- Real world video footage can be treated to validate a simulation output;
- Hand measured flows (e.g. number of pedestrians per minutes passing through a
  door) can validate some aspects too;
- but most of the time though, the only validation is the expert's opinion
  (movie director, military instructor...).

Anyway, in the end, for real-time use cases, validity comes in consideration
only after CPU/GPU/memory usage...
