Reading french magazine Marianne this week-end, I was intrigued by a small short
talking about the work of two CNRS researchers on crowd dynamics.

Knowing the prior work of those two researchers (Medhi Moussaïd and Guy
Theraulaz), in particular on small social groups (see my
[group navigation state-of-the-art report](/group-navigation-state-of-the-art-report).

This article present an cognitive science approach to autonomous navigation
based on observation and experimentation. It is quite similar to some of
[Julien Pettré's work](http://www.irisa.fr/bunraku/GENS/jpettre/pdf/SCA2009.pdf).
To compute the motion of entities, the presented model relies on two simple
heuristics computing the direction and the speed of the movement depending on
the distance to collision for the available directions. To this "intentionnal"
movements, a contact force is added to take into account the occurence of
unavoidable collision in high density cases. This addition is interesting as it
save the main model from handling those difficult cases ; I should try this!

In the prior art section, the authors compare heuristic base model (such as
theirs) to force base model (such as the social forces by Dirk Helbing, on of
the authors). They say, and having implemented social forces I agree, that these
models are hard to tune and ahve inherent flaws because they model reaction of
one-on-one interactions and doesn't provide a valid solution to combine those
forces. Those models are alos very dependent on the framerate due to their
integrative nature. This prior art section is really incomplete though, they
doesn't talk about other experiment based models (such as Julien Pettré's) nor
about geometric methods which are really popular (RVO and co.). Their method is
not compared to these approaches. I'll read
[Medhi Moussaïd Phd Thesis](http://mehdimoussaid.com/TheseMoussaid.pdf) (in
french) to see if the comparison work is done in it.

Anyway, and to go back to Marianne's article, I'm impressed by the communication
work that's been done as they're cited by general public press (another article
in
[Les Echos](http://www.lesechos.fr/innovation/technologies/0201429911498-un-nouveau-modele-de-simulation-de-foules-175868.php)
was just published)!
