The first post of 2012 (in May... shame on me) is about yet another migration of
the site!

As you may know Posterous, that I previously used, was
[bought by twitter](http://blog.posterous.com/big-news). It is pretty sure they
will close or at least let die their current service. So I moved everything to
[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/)! You can browse and even fork this
site's [repository](https://github.com/cloderic/cloderic.github.com). The setup
was a little longer than expected (basically you have to write html and css on
your own), but I'm pretty happy with the result and because its basically a git
repository of the site sources I have no fear of losing pages. More important,
my inner geek is satisfied!

I'll be back soon (hopefully) with real content !
