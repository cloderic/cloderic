## Environmentally Conscious AI: Improving Spatial Analysis and Reasoning

As game worlds become more complex, game characters need to become more "aware"
of their surroundings. These days, it is no longer sufficiently believable for
an agent to merely walk through these environments. Believable movement demands
so much more. Characters may now need to jump, climb, duck or vault in order to
navigate through their world. Additionally, simply "being" in a space brings in
issues with cover selection, visibility, positioning and other forms of spatial
awareness. In the past, this often meant time-consuming manual markup of levels
or highly constrained level designs, and it certainly didn't support dynamic
environments! This session will show two different architectures being
developed - one by [Havok](https://www.havok.com) and one by
[MASA](https://masasim.com) - to help automate those spatial issues in a way
that is independent of level design.

## The simplest trick in the book - Simple formation slot assignment

> The best slides I ever produced!
>
> This very short talk (\<5 min) shows a rather simpler method to compute
> assignments to formation slots for a group navigating agents.

## Turing Tantrums: AI Devs Rant!

> This was fun, and prepared at the last minute!
>
> Mine is at ~30 minutes and is about the curse of parametrization, a long
> lasting pet peeve of mine: "I can guarantee that you can't explain to me how
> to set those parameters".
