Data Council is a leading, community-driven conference focused on data science, engineering, analytics, and artificial intelligence.

I this talk, I discussed orchestrating human qualities like context awareness with AI combinatorial exploration abilities to enhance decision-making in critical areas such as emergency response and air traffic management. I showed how to develop effective human-AI teams by creating shared experiences and leveraging [AIR's framework, Cogment](https://cogment.ai). This approach addresses the limitations of traditional AI, aiming to augment rather than replace human capabilities in complex situations.
