The REAIM conference, held in The Hague, Netherlands, is a global summit focusing on
the responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the military domain. The event
centered on advancing the dialogue around ethical AI practices in military and
civilian settings.

In this panel, I was accompanied by [Siegfried Usal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siegfriedusal),
head of Thales Digital Solutions in Canada and former fighter pilot, [Ming Hou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ming-hou-7b12158/) Senior
Defence Scientist at the Canadian DRDC. The panel was moderated by [Hélène Bachatène](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-helene-bachatene-b6014a152/)
VP Research, Technology & Innovation at Thales, specifically in charge of Systems.

We discussed the key aspects and challenges of integrating AI with human teams,
particularly in military contexts. We emphasized the importance of creating robust,
reliable, and explainable AI systems to augment human capabilities and ensure
safety in operations.
