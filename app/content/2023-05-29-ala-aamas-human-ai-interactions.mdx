[AAMAS](https://aamas2023.soton.ac.uk), the International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, is a premier event in the field of artificial intelligence that focuses on both the theoretical and practical aspects of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems.

This paper is the result of a collaboration between [AIR](https://ai-r.com), [Thales](https://www.thalesgroup.com/), the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html) and [JACOBB.ai](https://www.jacobb.ai/).

The paper discusses the use of a novel multi-agent simulator for defense applications, based on [Cogment](https://cogment.ai), integrating human and AI capabilities to protect critical infrastructure like airports. By incorporating human feedback and demonstrations into the training of AI agents, the system leverages both human expertise and AI efficiency to enhance decision-making and response strategies in complex, dynamic scenarios. This approach not only improves the learning process and operational performance of AI agents but also maintains meaningful human control over critical tasks.
