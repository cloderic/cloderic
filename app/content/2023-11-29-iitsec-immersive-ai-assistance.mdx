The [Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation, and Education Conference (I/ITSEC)](https://www.iitsec.org/) is the world's largest event focused on modeling, simulation, and training technologies.

In this joint talk with [CAE](https://www.cae.com), we discussed the integration of advanced artificial intelligence techniques, including natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning (RL), into immersive flight training for eVTOL (electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing aircraft). By leveraging these AI capabilities, the training platform enhances pilot training with instant feedback, realistic air traffic control simulations, and robust scenario management in synthetic environments. The use of RL specifically contributes to a highly adaptive and effective training environment, optimizing pilot performance and decision-making in complex, dynamic conditions.
