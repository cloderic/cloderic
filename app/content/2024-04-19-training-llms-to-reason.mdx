In this blog post, I discuss the architecture we designed to enable trustworthy natural language interactions between human and AIs, particularly in industrial applications.

While LLMs have made unprecedented progress in mastering natural language conversation and expression, LLMs are not general AIs able to reason about the world. They are not even good at tracking the state of a simple domain. Cogment embraces a multi-agent approach to design decision making systems with a key principle: separate responsibilities into specialized, cooperating agents. In this context, the approach enables the LLM to manage language, and orchestrate it with other components/agents to actually create the ability to reason. Cogment is uniquely positioned to enable that orchestration of specialized components.
