This is a cover of "Swimming" by ["Émilie Simon"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Émilie_Simon) released on her 2006 album ["Végétal"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Végétal).

I discovered (and fell in love with) this song seeing Émilie Simon live and later listening over and over to her [2007 live album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Émilie_Simon_À_L%27Olympia). **Swimming** is one of those song that gives me chills and the occasional tear up. The gradual layering of melodies and counter melodies creates a tension that, when released, is everything I love about music.

This was a fun one to record and make mine a little. In the original [Live version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtTASY6bAoQ), a percussionist is playing a bowl of water that is later sampled in the performance. To achieve a similar effect, I sampled me and my son playing with a bowl of water in my backyard. I emulated the string quartet with guitar ebow lines. I played every instruments and recorded that track at home in Montreal between May and June 2024.

I'm not sure I achieved the same depth of arrangement, but I'm pretty happy with my version!
