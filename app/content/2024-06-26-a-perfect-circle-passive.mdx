This is a cover of ["Passive"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_(song)) by ["A Perfect Circle"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Perfect_Circle), originally released on their 2004 album ["eMOTIVe"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotive_(album)).

The song is part of eMOTIVe, a politically themed album featuring mostly covers. "Passive" is one of the few original tracks on the album and was created from the remnants of the ["Tapeworm"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapeworm_(band)) project. As a result, its credits include APC founders Maynard James Keenan and Billy Howerdel, along with Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor and Danny Lohner, who has been a member of both APC and Nine Inch Nails.

This song, along with the album, is designed to counter political apathy and encourage people to become more informed and involved. I found it particularly relevant to the current political climate, especially with the concurrent [2024 French Legislative Elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_French_legislative_election) and the rising threat of the far right in the country. It's the perfect song to shout out to the world: "You fucking disappoint me!"
