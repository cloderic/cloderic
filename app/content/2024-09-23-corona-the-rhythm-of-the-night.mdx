This is a cover of
["The Rhythm of the Night"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rhythm_of_the_Night)
by ["Corona"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona_(band)>), originally
released as their debut single in 1993.

I was 9 years old when this song came out. Back then, eurodance was everywhere,
but not on our home hi-fi — my parents were quite successful in shaping our
musical tastes, from Blind Willie Johnson to Bach. As a result, eurodance, and
to a lesser extent, the later boy bands, have always felt like a guilty pleasure
from my childhood.

A few years ago, I had already done an acoustic cover of “The Rhythm of the
Night” with “Cartel,” performing it at the “Fête de la Musique” in Colombes.
This version, though, is definitely funkier and turned into a fun, late-summer
project!
