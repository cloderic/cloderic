## Summary

## Reading notes

- Looks at nonverbal behaviors needed for interactions with humans and how
  non-anthropomorphic robots could integrate those expressive qualities. It's
  about affordances, interactio, cues, etc...
  > While much of the research separates pragmatic robotics—such as robotic arms
  > performing household tasks—from social robotics, like therapeutic robots
  > providing emotional support, we argue that any robot interacting with
  > humans, even if designed primarily for practical functions, embodies social
  > value and should have its design and behaviors shaped accordingly.
- Hardware + software + storyboards of interactions
- Focuses on design + user studies to get insight on what matters, not on
  movement generation & co.
- Lamp form primary inspiration is - of course - Luxo Jr.
  - They also consider the alignment between form and users expectactions (eg
    humanoid robots might lead to the expectation of supporting more social
    engagment)
  - "Heider-Simmel Illusion" demosntrates that humans ca project character and
    metaphorical states on moving objects even it they are simple geometric
    shapes it they seem to move on their own accord - ie autonomously (cf.
    wizard of oz effect).
- Formulation -> MDP with a reward function decomposed in two parts: functional
  utility and expressive utility.
  - Expressive utility aims at commucationg the robots the robots traits, state
    and intents. The capture 4 dimensions:
    - **intention** -> ability for the user to anticipate actions / movements.
    - **attention** -> ability for the user to understand where is the focus of
      the robot.
    - **attitude** -> stance towards a person, object or event: expressing
      agreement, confidence, ...
    - **emotion** -> THIS IS NOT ABOUT ACTUAL EMOTION but they argue it is
      needed to simulate emotional expressions to create intuitive and engagine
      interactions.
- Building blocks: movement primitives
  - Kinesics -> body movements
  - Proxemics -> Management of spatial distance in relation to the environment
- Experiments follow 6 scenarios
  - Really like their classification reactive / proactive and functional /
    social
- User Study
  - They compare with and without expressive utility
  - Two clear research questions: do users care about the expressivity ? does it depends on the task ?
  - Users are presented with recordigns, the video are "acted": 
    - the robot follows prerecorded trajectories, 
    - note -> what about the bias induced by the human acting ?
  - 6 dimensions rating:
    - human-likeliness
    - perceived intelligence
    - perceived emotion/character
    - interaction engagement
    - the sense of connection
    - willingness to use the robot (<- which honestly seems like the only one we care about)
    - Note -> the dimensions are really skewed towards expression and not really functionnality it would have been interesting to capture how people were peceivining utility or efficiency. "Future research should balance the trade-off between task efficiency and characterfulness in human- robot interaction" yes, not sure why it wasn't done here though.
  - Quantitative results are supporting the hypothesises
  - Qualitative results are interesting too:
    - Expressive robots seems to get better at having users inferencing the robot state but users also map intentions / state to the functional robot.
    - Noting the balance between expressivity and efficiency "stick to only the task relevant motion which is angle and the light"
    - Also interesting (predicable but interesting) "many participants were less accept- able to robot taking proactive roles than reactive roles"
    - But playfullness could increase the acceptance of robot behavior "Without the playfulness, I might find this type of interaction with a robot annoying rather than welcome and engaging."
