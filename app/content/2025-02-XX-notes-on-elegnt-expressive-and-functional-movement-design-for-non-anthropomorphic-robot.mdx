## Summary

## Reading notes

- Looks at nonverbal behaviors needed for interactions with humans and how
  non-anthropomorphic robots could integrate those expressive qualities. It's
  about affordances, interactio, cues, etc...
  > While much of the research separates pragmatic robotics—such as robotic arms
  > performing household tasks—from social robotics, like therapeutic robots
  > providing emotional support, we argue that any robot interacting with
  > humans, even if designed primarily for practical functions, embodies social
  > value and should have its design and behaviors shaped accordingly.
- Hardware + software + storyboards of interactions
- Focuses on design + user studies to get insight on what matters, not on
  movement generation & co.
- Lamp form primary inspiration is - of course - Luxo Jr.
  - They also consider the alignment between form and users expectactions (eg
    humanoid robots might lead to the expectation of supporting more social
    engagment)
  - "Heider-Simmel Illusion" demosntrates that humans ca project character and
    metaphorical states on moving objects even it they are simple geometric
    shapes it they seem to move on their own accord - ie autonomously (cf.
    wizard of oz effect).
- Formulation -> MDP with a reward function decomposed in two parts: functional
  utility and expressive utility.
  - Expressive utility aims at commucationg the robots the robots traits, state
    and intents. The capture 4 dimensions:
    - **intention** -> ability for the user to anticipate actions / movements.
    - **attention** -> ability for the user to understand where is the focus of
      the robot.
    - **attitude** -> stance towards a person, object or event: expressing
      agreement, confidence, ...
    - **emotion** -> THIS IS NOT ABOUT ACTUAL EMOTION but they argue it is
      needed to simulate emotional expressions to create intuitive and engagine
      interactions.
- Building blocks: movement primitives
  - Kinesics -> body movements
  - Proxemics -> Management of spatial distance in relation to the environment
- Experiments follow 6 scenarios
  - Really like their classification reactive / proactive and functional /
    social
