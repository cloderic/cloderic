This is a cover of
["...Baby One More Time"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...Baby_One_More_Time)
by ["Britney Spears"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears), originally
released on her 1999 album
[of the same name](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...Baby_One_More_Time_(album)>).

I was 15 in 1999 and remember very well this afternoon playing Magic The
Gathering (yes) at a friend's house. Someone brought 2 CDs he had just bought
that day: Noir Désir's 666.667 Club, which would become one of my most listened
album, before it got, you know, harder to listen to; and "...Baby One More
Time".

This kind of pop wasn’t typical for my friend group’s musical taste, but we
nevertheless got hooked on Max Martin’s overproduced pop magic. Over the
following years, the title track became a guilty pleasure and one of those songs
I just couldn’t stop humming. I still can’t. When playing with
[Two Clouds Away](./2007-09-02-two-clouds-away-demo.mdx), I often used it for
vocal soundchecks—good dynamic range and an excellent way to annoy my bandmates.

Earlier this summer, I was at a friend’s wedding when the band invited guests to
sing with them. But …Baby One More Time wasn’t in their repertoire—a cultural
loss that shook the very fabric of society.

Naturally, I did the only sensible thing: I went home and recorded my own
version. I kept the arrangement as simple as possible, taking inspiration from
Royal Blood’s drum + octave-fuzzed-bass setup (though I used a guitar), merged
with a beat machine that wouldn’t feel out of place on a Nine Inch Nails record.

I hope you enjoy it! If you do, you might enjoy [more of my music...](/music)
