Second entry in my little series of covers of pop songs I unironically love,
stripped down to minimalistic arrangements. After
[Britney’s Baby One More Time](./2025-08-09-britney-spears-baby-one-more-time),
here comes Aqua’s ["Barbie Girl"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie_Girl) by
["Aqua"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_(band)>), originally released on
their 1997 album
["Aquarium"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarium_(Aqua_album)>).

This track has always fascinated me: it’s one of the most fun juxtapositions
between bubblegum energy and lyrics that, once you stop dancing, feel kind of
dark. Like the Barbie movie that came years later, it balances on that strange
line between satire, social commentary, and shameless capitalistic product. And
I’m absolutely here for it.

Anyway, this was another fun exercise in rearranging and recording. I hope you
enjoy listening as much as I enjoyed putting it together.
