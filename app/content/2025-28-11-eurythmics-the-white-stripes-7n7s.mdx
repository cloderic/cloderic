This is the third — and for now, final — entry in my _Dance Macabre_ series,
after [...Baby One More Time](./2025-08-09-britney-spears-baby-one-more-time)
and [Barbie Girl](./2025-09-21-aqua-barbie-girl). The idea behind the series is
simple: take unapologetically pop songs, strip them down to their bones, and
rebuild them for beatbox, guitar, and voice — with a jagged industrial-rock
pulse underneath.

I first performed 7N7S at the
["Cabaret des Horreurs" hosted by Barre Oblique](https://barreoblique.org/le-cabaret-des-horreurs/a-propos-de-le-cabaret-des-horreurs/)
in late October. The reception was great — maybe the best of the three — with a
few fun rug pulls as the audience started singing one song just as I veered into
the other.

The concept of _mashupping_
[Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Dreams_(Are_Made_of_This)>)
and [Seven Nation Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Nation_Army) isn’t
mine originally —
[Pomplamoose](https://youtu.be/hmLBSCiEoas?si=QyjH8MyJFMrRhyC_) did a version
years ago, and they deserve the credit for sparking the idea. I leaned into the
darker edge by borrowing the Marilyn Manson rendition of the Sweet Dreams riff
and making it unapologetically guitar-heavy.

Everything you hear was performed, recorded, and mixed by me at home in
November 2025.
