the collaboration between Humans and AIs. At Inria then at Golaem and MASA Group
he has worked on explicit AI techniques applied to video games, simulation and
special effects. In 2015, he co-founded craft ai to focus on explainable machine

accessible to create collaborative systems including humans and AIs. Over the
years, he contributed to the development of AIs collaborating with artists to
populate movie shots, designers to understand transportation infrastructure
