Since 2006, I've been dedicated to one primary mission: **fostering the
collaboration between Humans and AIs**.

My journey began in a research lab at [Inria](https://inria.fr), then moved
through its startup spinoff [Golaem](http://golaem.com), and later
[MASA Group](https://masasim.com). During those early years, I focused on
explicit AI techniques for video games, simulations, and visual effects.

In 2015, I co-founded [craft ai](https://craft.ai) in Paris to make machine
learning more explainable—especially for time-series prediction in real-world
operations. In 2020, I crossed the Atlantic to join
[AI Redefined](https://www.ai-r.com) in Montréal, where I led the development of
the Cogment platform for human-AI collaboration. That work continues today at
[CM Labs](https://www.cm-labs.com), which acquired AIR in 2025.

Over the years, I’ve worked on AIs that collaborate with:

- artists, to populate movie shots,
- designers, to understand and optimize infrastructure usage,
- instructors, to create realistic and purposeful training,
- engineers, to operate and maintain complex industrial systems.

I thrive at the crossroads of research and product, turning algorithms into real
B2B impact. [Along the way](/resume), I’ve recruited and led amazing teams of
engineers and researchers, built product roadmaps, and driven collaborative R&D
programs—all while staying hands-on with architecture and code.

Oh, and when I’m not working, I make music. [Take a listen](/music) if you’re
curious.
