Since 2006, I've been dedicated to one primary mission: **fostering the collaboration between Humans and AIs**.

My adventure began at a research lab within [Inria](https://inria.fr), before venturing into their startup spinoff, [Golaem](http://golaem.com), and later, [MASA Group](https://masasim.com).During these initial years, I focused on explicit AI techniques for video games, simulations, and special effects. In 2015, I co-founded [craft ai](https://craft.ai) in Paris, turning my attention to making machine learning more explainable, particularly for time-series prediction and analysis. By 2020, my adventure brought me across the Atlantic to Montréal, where I joined [AI Redefined](https://www.ai-r.com). Here, I lead the development of the Cogment orchestration platform, which aims to deepen the collaboration, trust, and alignment between humans and AIs.

Throughout my career, I contributed to the development of AIs collaborating with:

- artists, to populate movie shots,
- designers, to understand transportation infrastructure usage,
- instructors, to create realistic and purposeful military training,
- engineers, to operate and maintain industrial infrastructures.

I thrive at the crossroads of research and industry, transforming innovative algorithms into practical B2B solutions. [Over the years](/resume), I've recruited and led talented teams of engineers and PhDs, designed product roadmaps, and coordinated collaborative R&D programs—all while maintaining a hands-on approach to architecture and coding.

Oh, and when I'm not working, I indulge in my passion for music. Feel free to [check out some of my recordings](/music).
