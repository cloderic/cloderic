  AI Product Engineer & Tech Leader, turning research prototypes into enterprise
  products since 2006
intro: |
  **Creative, enthusiastic and thoughtful software engineer & tech leader!**

  Since 2006, I'm building AIs with one overarching goal: fostering
  **collaboration between Humans and AIs**.

  To bridge the gap between research and productization, I've developed a wide
  range of skills: AI and ML algorithms, applied data science, distributed cloud
  architecture, API design, product & tech roadmap management, workshop
  facilitation, customer & partners relationships.

  Over the years my role has evolved from individual contributor, to team
  leader, to managing several teams internally and in coordination with external
  stakeholders. As CTO of craft ai and VP Engineering of AI Redefined, I
  recruited and led teams of 15+ AI researchers, software engineers and data
  scientists in challenging deep tech startup environments.

  I have experience working in multi-cultural and international environments
  with full proficiency in both French, my native language, and English.
