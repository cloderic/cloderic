  AI Product Engineer & Tech Leader, turning research prototypes into enterprise
  products since 2006
intro: |
  Since 2006, I have specialized in **fostering human-AI collaboration**. My projects have enabled artists to direct autonomous characters in movies, helped engineers optimize transportation infrastructure, provided trainees with personalized training simulations, and assisted operators in improving energy infrastructure.

  I excel at **bridging cutting-edge research and B2B applications**. My leadership includes recruiting and guiding teams in high-pressure, deep tech environments. I design and lead strategic product and R&D roadmaps, while remaining hands-on with technical architecture and coding.

  As a **generalist software engineer**, my skills include human-in-the-loop systems design, applied AI, distributed cloud architecture, and full-stack development. I communicate effectively in both French and English, articulating complex ideas clearly and persuasively.
