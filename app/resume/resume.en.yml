  AI Product Engineer & Tech Leader, turning research prototypes into enterprise
  products since 2006
intro: |
  Since 2006, I have been deeply committed to a singular goal: **fostering the collaboration between humans and AIs**. Throughout my career, I have significantly contributed to various projects where AI augments human expertise. These projects include enhancing movie production with AI-driven characters, optimizing transportation infrastructure through simulation & data analysis, developing effective & realistic training simulations, and improving the efficiency of energy infrastructure operations.

  I excel at **bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and B2B applications**. My leadership spans recruiting and guiding teams of engineers and researchers within high-pressure, deep tech startup environments. I design strategic product roadmaps and spearhead collaborative R&D programs, always ensuring I remain hands-on with technical architecture and coding.

  A **generalist software engineer**, my competencies include human-in-the-loop systems design, applied AI, distributed cloud architecture, and full-stack development. I am also an effective communicator, proficient in both French and English, capable of articulating complex ideas clearly and persuasively.
