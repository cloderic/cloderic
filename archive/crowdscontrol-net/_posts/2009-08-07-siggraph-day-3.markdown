Wednesday had been quite a busy day for me, I started the day at 8:30 for a group of technical papers presentation called "Motion Synthesis and Editing". I'm really not a specialists but it was in interesting, there was three presented papers:
 - Generalizing Motion Edits With Gaussian Processes, it shows a method to refineexisting motions via editing them automatically based on the samples of the desired edit, I didn't quite get everything (too early I think) but it seems powerful;
 - Optimization-Based Interactive Motion Synthesis, the described platform, given a goal and constraints, is able to synthesize the motion needed to attain that goal by optimizing different physical parameters, the article is waiting for me to read it;
 - Lie Group Integrators for Animation and Control of Vehicles, the algorithms shown here are able to synthesize the motion of a non-holonomic vehicles via optimization given a goal and some constraint using the Lie Group, I was quite impressed by the result they get but after the talk I was told by St√©phane that those kind of stuff was known in robotics for years.

I then attended to the third keynote of this SIGGRAPH: New York Times Steve Duendes talking about data visualization and aesthetics. As a follower of blog dedicated to the subject such as [Flowing Data](http://flowingdata.com/) I really enjoyed the talk, it seems quite odd to find this subject at SIGGRAPH though.
As nothing really interested me in the beginning of the afternoon, I took this opportunity to do some light tourism. It was pretty hot but New Orleans has some cute corners. I spent the end of the afternoon on technical stuffs: a nvidia talk about their scene graph and how its interactions with other of their stuffs and a chat with an Autodesk engineer about Kynapse, their solution for virtual characters pathfinding, steering and a little bit of AI. I then joined other french SIGGRAPHers for a drink and a dinner, that's why you didn't have the pleasure to read my prose yesterday.
