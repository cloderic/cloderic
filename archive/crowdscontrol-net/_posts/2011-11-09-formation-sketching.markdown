I have updated the Group navigation state-of-the-art report with an interesting article I read a few weeks ago:
* *Qin Gu and Zhigang Deng. Formation Sketching: An Approach to Stylize Groups in Crowd Simulation. In Graphics Interface. University Houston, Delmar Thomson Learning, 2011*

I've also set up a [static page](/group-navigation-state-of-the-art-report/) for the report.
