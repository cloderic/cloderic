This Thursday was my 4th day for this SIGGRAPH, it was also the last day for the
exhibition. After a little sleepover my day started by the fist session of
technical papers dedicated to character animations, really interesting but quite
complex for my bad skills in the domain.

- **Dextrous manipulation from a graping pose.** This paper presents a way to
  compute a character's hand motion from the motion of the object it handles. As
  I understand, once the hand has grasped the object, the system will handle its
  movements taking into account the friction coeficient of the material (but not
  its weight).
- **Optimal Gait and Form for Animal Locomotion,** is a method able to
  automatically generate the morphology and the motion for any animal having any
  number of legs. The animal is described using cylinders of variable sizes and
  some constraints. Their method is able to recreate belivable horse, giraffes,
  etc... They can even create motions for imaginary animal with 5 legs (the
  video is watchable here).
- **Performance-Based Control Interface for Character Animation.** The work
  presented here is quite impressive and could be immediatly applied to game
  consoles. The authors original observations is that with the current trend for
  motion-driven games inputs (wii, project natal...), soon we'll be able to
  match exactly the character's motions to the player's. But in some cases
  (climbing a ladder, jumping on a trampoline), the user can't reproduce the
  movements in his living room. The presented method is able to match the
  player's motions type to a type of character's motion while keeping as much 1
  to 1 motion mapping as possible. On the ladder example, the arms and hip
  motions of the players can be mapped directly on the character while the rest
  is taken from offline recorded motions.
- **Detail-Preserving Continuum Simulation of Straight Hair.** I must admit I
  did not pay that much attention to this talk...

The following session I attended was called "Effects Omelette": 4 talks about
various movies special effects.

- People from Disney animation talked about how they setup the production
  pipeline of Bolt in order to produce only one movie in 2D and stereoscopic 3D.
- "Virtual" taylors from Pixar gave a talk about how they designed the
  characters clothes in Up. Pretty interesting to see how they "virtualized"
  traditionnal tayloring techniques in order to get realistic looking clothes.
- One of the technical guys who had worked on Up talked about the net
  simulations he designed (in fact it was the same piece of work that was used
  for the ballon canopy).
- Finally, Digital Domain presented how they simulate the Eiffel tower
  collapsing in GI Joe, introducing their talk by "The movie has been released
  last week, surprisingly it has some good reviews !"...

The afternoon, I explored the third floor : modern art, scientific posters and
japanese presenting weird, but interesting, "emerging technologies". I then
attended to a production session about how they 3d-printed every faces in
"Coraline", very impressive ! But it was quite a paradox to learn that, for the
faces, the created 3d models, animated them for lip synching and facial
expression and then printed every frame to recreate, in stop motion, those
animations.

This thursday night was the official reception night: New Orleans Mardi Gras,
fanfare and buffet.
