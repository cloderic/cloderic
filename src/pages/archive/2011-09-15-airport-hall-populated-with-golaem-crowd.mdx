A new showcase video of Golaem Crowd has been published a few days ago. It
features our new integration with the rendering engine VRay, but most
importantly (from my point of view) it shows the capabilities of our navigation
engine. The animation is not that good though, especially compared to the new
things we're developing.

Anyway this is a great showcase for the navigation engine I've been developing
since more than 2 years. The path following is natural and the collision
avoidances are smooth !

Please enjoy !
