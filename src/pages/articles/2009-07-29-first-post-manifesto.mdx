For some times now I have wanted to create some kind of "pro" blog but I never
took the time, until now. I'm going to SIGGRAPH for the first time next week and
I want a place where I can report some of what I'll learn there. So here we go !

I work since 2006 in 3D related fields : behavioral animation, crowd simulation,
virtual realistic cities, authoring tools for 3d content... As I still consider
myself a newbie, I'm constantly and eagerly trying to gather infos and learn.
Hopefully, my current job at [Golaem](http://www.golaem.com) allows me just
that. This blog will be a place for me to formalise and keep some of those
interesting stuffs and, incidentally share them. Quantitatively, I'll try to
post articles every week or two ; I've also created a twitter as a sidekick for
this blog, you can check it [here](http://www.twitter.com/clodericmars) or on
the left side of the blog page.
