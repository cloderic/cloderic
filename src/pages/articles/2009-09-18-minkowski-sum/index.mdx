Since the end of my master's internship I hadn't really followed what was going
on in the academic world about autonomous agent steering. I've done some catchup
lately ; this post is a preamble to some article report I'm planning to do. Here
it is, a few slides about the Minkowski sum, a fun geometric function used
notably in motion planning.

<Pdf

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query {
    pdf: file(name: { eq: "minkowski-sum-applied-to-2d-geometry" }) {
      publicURL
    }
  }
