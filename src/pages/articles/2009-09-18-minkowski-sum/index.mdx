Since the end of my master's internship I hadn't really followed what was going
on in the academic world about autonomous agent steering. I've done some catchup
lately ; this post is a preamble to some article report I'm planning to do. Here
it is, a few slides about the Minkowski sum, a fun geometric function used
notably in motion planning.
