I have updated the Group navigation state-of-the-art report with an interesting
article I read a few weeks ago:

- _Qin Gu and Zhigang Deng. Formation Sketching: An Approach to Stylize Groups
  in Crowd Simulation. In Graphics Interface. University Houston, Delmar Thomson
  Learning, 2011_

I've also set up a [static page](/group-navigation-state-of-the-art-report/) for
the report.
