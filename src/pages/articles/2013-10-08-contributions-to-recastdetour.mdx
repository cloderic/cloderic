In a previous [post](../2013-03-21-recast-detour-in-masa-life) I've announced
that, as a part of our work on [MASA LIFE](http://www.masalife.net), the team
will work with Recast/Detour and that we would release our updates to the
community.

This have been effective since the beginning of the summer and we're just
releasing today a new version which is the first to be used in a released
version of MASA LIFE, the upcoming (if all goes well, this week) v1.2. Our work
is available on github at <https://github.com/masagroup/recastdetour>.

# Introduced features

## Modular _crowd_ framework

`DetourCrowd` was a rather monolithical, we redesigned a large part of its basic
framework with two goals in mind: modularity and usage safety. In the process we
introduced several new concepts:

- **Navigation behaviors**, self-contained navigation algorithms defining how
  agents take movement decisions, eg. how they update their velocity (cf. the
  [user documentation](http://masagroup.github.io/recastdetour/group__behavior.html)),
  such behavior is assigned to each agent and used to update it, the existing
  path following and collision avoidance algorithms were encapsulated in
  navigation behaviors;

- **Indirect agents access**, forbidding direct read or write to `dtAgent`,
  introducing explicit fetch/push queries based on the agent's `id`, as a result
  it is easier to make checks (are we out of the navmesh?) and the users always
  safely manipulate data (cf. the
  [user documentation](http://masagroup.github.io/recastdetour/group__crowd.html));

- Modular **Update loop**, allowing more complex update strategy by supporting
  the update of part of the crowd in different steps, environment, velocity and
  position (cf. the
  [user documentation](http://masagroup.github.io/recastdetour/group__crowd.html)).

## Navigation tests

We introduced unit tests on 'DetourCrowd' in order to test the new features we
introduced. We chose to use [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) mainly
because it is dependency free and with an active community.

Additionally we created a simple framework to create _functional_ visual tests
for navigation based on JSON configuration files.

# Known issues

This fork is still very young and several issues are remaining. The most
important being:

- Bad usage of the pathfinding queue in the path following behavior;
- _Dumb_ neighbors retrieving, we had to remove the previous proximity grid that
  couldn't work properly with multi-level scenes;
- Removal of the navigation test features from the _RecastDemo_ application, we
  didn't took the time to port them to the new framework.

Once we are fully happy with our state, we'll send a pull request to Mikko and
make these updates part of the "main" repository. In the meantime contributions
and issue reporting are welcome!

We have nice features in the MASA LIFE pipe that will surely lead to new
contributions. I'll keep the community in touch on this blog or on the
[Recast Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/recastnavigation).
