How can Simulation + Humans help create a new generation of AIs able to new
challenges?

I this talk I gave at [Hub France IA](https://www.hub-franceia.fr), I show how
reinforcement learning (RL) can leverage simulated environment to go beyond
dataset-driven machine learning techniques make more _optimal_ and more
_creative_ decisions. In turn, I explain how creating common experiences betwen
AIs and Humans can overcome limitations of RL, an approach facilitated by
[Cogment](https://www.cogment.ai) the framework we develop at
[AIR](https://www.ai-r.com).
