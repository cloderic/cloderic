## Hello, there!

I'm an enthusiastic, thoughtful and humming (mostly bad songs) software engineer creating **AIs that can collaborate with Humans**, with the goal of making them **actually useful**.

Starting in 2006, my early work was focused on developing authoring tools enabling non-specialists to create **_directable_ AIs**, such as crowds of virtual autonomous characters, for video games, simulation and special effects at [INRIA](https://inria.fr), [Golaem](http://golaem.com) and then at [MASA Group](https://masasim.com).

Building upon these experiences I've **launched [craft ai](https://craft.ai) in 2015** with a few colleagues to implement a singular vision: help enterprises create and operate AIs that leverage their data while keeping humans, employees and end-users alike, in the loop.

As CTO, I've recruited a team of ~15 Engineers & PhDs and led them to **research and develop** innovative **explainable AI** algorithms, featured in peer-reviewed [publications](https://github.com/craft-ai/sci), **design and operate** a distributed and scalable cloud platform generating >100k predictive models per month, **setup and support** customers solutions integrating the engine.

Throughout the years, I've developed an **extensive public speaking experience**: giving [technical](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1020571/Environmentally-Conscious-AI-Improving-Spatial) or [inspirational](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzXtmjC78r4) conferences, facilitating [workshop](https://sc21.fr/total-retour-sur-la-session-aiforleaders-du-24-mai/) & [round tables](https://www.craft.ai/blog/ai-night-2019-explainable-ai-workshop), both in French and English.
