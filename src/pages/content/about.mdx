I'm an enthusiastic, thoughtful and humming (mostly bad songs) software engineer
creating **AIs that can collaborate with Humans**.

Starting in 2006, my early work was focused on developing authoring tools
enabling non-specialists to create **directable AIs**, such as crowds of virtual
autonomous characters, for video games, simulation and special effects at
[INRIA](https://inria.fr), [Golaem](http://golaem.com) and then at
[MASA Group](https://masasim.com).

Building upon these experiences, a few colleagues and I **launched
[craft ai](https://craft.ai) in 2015** to implement a singular vision: help
enterprises create and operate AIs that leverage their data while keeping
**humans in the loop**. As CTO, I recruited and led a team of ~15 Engineers &
PhDs to build, operate and sell a cloud platform training and operating >100k
predictive models per month based on our own novel **explainable AI** algorithm.

In August 2020, I joined [AI Redefined](https://www.ai-r.com) in Montr√©al to
contribute to their mission: enabling AIs and Humans to trust and continuously
learn from each others. At AIR, I'm working at the interface between AI R&D,
product engineering and business to steer and facilitate the execution of the
roadmap towards the democratization of **steerable AI**.

Throughout the years, I've developed an **extensive public speaking
experience**: giving
